# Python-based-voice-assistant
As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. So I wrote a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need.  This voice assistant behaves as Alexa or Google assistant. This assistant can talk to you or communicate with you using your voice like Google Assistant or Alexa. But, this will not be that much advanced, this will totally depend on the if-else condition which I used in the program.
