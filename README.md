# Python-based-voice-assistant
As we know Python is a suitable language for script writers and developers. So I wrote a script for Voice Assistant using Python. The query for the assistant can be manipulated as per the user’s need.  This voice assistant behaves as Alexa or Google assistant. This assistant can talk to you or communicate with you using your voice like Google Assistant or Alexa. But, this will not be that much advanced, this will totally depend on the if-else condition which I used in the program.
For storing record of commands and reviews given by the user, I have created a database using sqlite3. 


## Features:
This AI voice assistant can do following things:
1) Voice assistant is able to do conversation with you.
2) It is able to do any kind of calculation such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, trigonometric operations, etc.
3) This voice assistant having two voices. i.e., male voice and female voice. We can use any one of them and we can change that voice any time.
4) It is able to give answer of any question.
5) It can open any website, YouTube, Google. We have to tell the name of that website to the voice assistant to open that website.
6) It is able to open any app and file in your device. e.g. Word, Excel, WhatsApp, Gallery, etc.
7) It is able to tell us current time and current, tomorrow, yesterday and some other dates.
8) It can handle WhatsApp on voice commands using Pyautogui functions. (This will work only in full screen mode and only if the co-ordinates of particular positions are not changed. If it doesn't work then you need to change the co-ordinates of particular positions in the code.)
9) It is able to send mail to other mail id using voice commands.
10) It can click your photo.
11) It can take screenshot.
12) We can set alarm in it.
13) We can play Tic Tac Toe game which I have made using Tkinter and also some online games which I linked to it.
14) It is able to do sentiment analysis by inputting emojis.
15) It is able to detect human faces.
16) It can perform brightness control, sound control, night light control, etc. by voice commands.
17) It is able to play some keys of piano.
18) After giving the command to the voice assistant, that command stored in my database. 
19) We can give the review to this voice assistant and it will be recorded in the database.
and some other functions....

## Requirements:
1) Install DB Browser to store this database.
2) Install all required libraries which I have imported in the code. Some libraies are already available.
3) Install this libraries: pyttsx3, speech_recognition, pyaudio, wikipedia, webbrowser, smtplib, winsound, pyautogui, cv2, pygame, tkinter, sqlite3
